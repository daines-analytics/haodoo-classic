1 – A Summons to the White House<br>
<br>
 Josh lay strapped to the wheeled stretcher as the hospital orderly pushed him down the corridor toward Operating Room B. Though groggy from sedation, he was sufficiently alert to know what was happening. "Strange," he chuckled to himself, "I've been looking forward to this for two years, but now ..."<br>
 <br>
 Upon entering the room, he gazed about and saw the green - tiled walls, the huge nonshadow light in the center of the ceiling above the specially designed operating table. He also noticed the monitor which, after the transducers had been attached to him, would provide a constant indication of his temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Here and there he saw weird - looking machines equipped with tubes and bags and dials and other odd - shaped paraphernalia. Beside the operating table stood three surgeons, two nurses, and an anesthetist, all in white and wearing caps and masks, all ready and waiting.<br>
 <br>
 While being wheeled toward the table, Josh turned his head from side to side and finally spotted what he was looking for: the glass cabinet in which hung a black oceanaut's suit. <br>
